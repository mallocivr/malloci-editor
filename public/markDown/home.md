# Malloci
​
*A MarkDown parser for WebVR.*
​
## Intro
Malloci is a set of tools to help non-developers create Web-based VR content. Currently, creating a VR experience for the web requires a strong working knowledge of web development, game development, or both. This makes for a pretty steep learning curve, and results in a very limited amount of content.
​

Malloci attempts to lower this barrier by allowing users to create informational WebVR content using MarkDown instead.

## Platform agnostic
Malloci is platform agnostic, which means that exhibits created using Malloci can be explored on anything from phones, using a Google CardBoard headset, to any of the mid to high end headsets, such as the Oculus Go, Rift, Quest, or Valve Index. Additionally, since it is webVR, it can be viewed on a laptop, using a mouse and keyboard.

## The future is VR
Encouraging this proliferation of VR has its advantages; in addition to breaking barriers to generating VR content, we want to make it available for more people to consume, too. As a medium, virtual reality lends itself to radical, creative, exciting ways of consuming content incomparable to reading text on a screen. The potential praxes are infinite.
